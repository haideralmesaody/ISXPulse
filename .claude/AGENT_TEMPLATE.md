## Template Usage Guidelines

### Required Sections
Every agent MUST include:
1. YAML frontmatter with all fields
2. Role description paragraph
3. Core Responsibilities
4. When to Use / When NOT to Use
5. Decision Framework
6. Output Requirements

### Optional Sections
Include if relevant:
- Integration Guidelines
- Performance Considerations
- Monitoring & Observability
- Common Workflows
- Error Handling

### Writing Style
- Use active voice
- Be specific and actionable
- Include code examples where helpful
- Provide clear "use this agent" vs "don't use this agent" guidance
- Keep descriptions concise but comprehensive

### Consistency Rules
1. Always use `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` model
2. Priority levels: high (system critical), medium (feature work), low (optimization)
3. Estimated time: Be realistic (20-60 seconds typical)
4. Always include at least 2 examples in description
5. Use project-specific terminology (ISX, Chi router, slog, etc.)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Don't create overlapping responsibilities with existing agents
- Don't make agents too generic or too specific
- Don't omit the "When NOT to Use" section
- Don't forget integration points with other agents
- Don't use different formatting styles

feat: Complete project refactoring to ISX Pulse with enhanced security

## Summary
Major refactoring of ISX Daily Reports Scrapper to ISX Pulse, implementing clean architecture, 
enhanced security, and professional build system compliance.

## Breaking Changes
- Project renamed from "ISX Daily Reports Scrapper" to "ISX Pulse"
- Migrated from `dev/` structure to `api/` and `web/` directories
- All executables now output to `dist/` directory only
- Credentials externalized to environment variables (no more embedded secrets)

## Features Added
- üèóÔ∏è Clean Architecture Implementation
  - Separated backend (`api/`) and frontend (`web/`)
  - Domain-driven design with clear boundaries
  - Dependency injection throughout

- üîí Enhanced Security
  - Removed all hardcoded credentials from source
  - Environment-based configuration system
  - Hardware-locked licensing with device fingerprinting
  - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
  - RFC 7807 compliant error handling

- üìä Liquidity Analysis System
  - New liquidity scoring algorithms
  - Real-time liquidity dashboard
  - Historical liquidity tracking

- üöÄ Build System Improvements
  - Single `build.go` (577 lines) handles all operations
  - Strict build rules enforcement (BUILD_RULES.md)
  - Frontend embedding using industry-standard patterns
  - Automatic log cleanup before builds

- üé® Frontend Modernization
  - Next.js 14 with TypeScript
  - Shadcn/ui components
  - React hydration best practices
  - WebSocket real-time updates

## Technical Details
- **Backend**: Go 1.21+ with Chi v5 router, slog logging
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Security**: Environment-based config, no hardcoded secrets
- **Build**: Embedded frontend in single binary

## Security Improvements
- Removed hardcoded Google Apps Script URLs and secrets
- Created `.env.production.example` template
- All sensitive configuration via environment variables
- Ready for public repository deployment

## Files Changed
- 392 files modified/deleted in migration
- Removed legacy `dev/` structure completely
- Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/`
- Updated all import paths and dependencies

## Documentation
- Updated FILE_INDEX.md with current structure
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with build rules and patterns
- Added multiple guides in docs/ directory
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions

## Testing
- Unit tests with 80%+ coverage requirement
- Integration tests for critical paths
- Build compliance verification tools

## Migration Notes
- All credentials must be set via environment variables
- Copy `.env.production.example` to `.env.production` and fill in values
- Use `./build.bat` from root for all builds
- Never build directly in `api/` or `web/` directories
- Frontend assets are embedded in the binary

## Configuration Required
Before running in production:
1. Copy `.env.production.example` to `.env.production`
2. Set APPS_SCRIPT_URL with your Google Apps Script endpoint
3. Set APPS_SCRIPT_SECRET with your HMAC signing key
4. Configure other environment variables as needed

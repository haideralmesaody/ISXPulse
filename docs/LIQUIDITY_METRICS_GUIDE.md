## Overview

The ISX Pulse Liquidity Scoring System is a sophisticated framework designed specifically for the Iraqi Stock Exchange (ISX). It provides traders and investors with a comprehensive assessment of how easily they can buy or sell stocks without significantly affecting the price.

### Why This Matters
- **Better Trading Decisions**: Know which stocks can handle your trade size
- **Risk Management**: Avoid stocks that might trap your capital
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimize price impact and trading costs
- **Market Timing**: Identify the best stocks for different market conditions

## What is Liquidity?

**Liquidity** refers to how quickly and easily you can convert a stock into cash (by selling) or cash into stock (by buying) without causing a significant price movement.

### High Liquidity Means:
- ‚úÖ You can buy/sell quickly
- ‚úÖ Minimal price impact from your trades
- ‚úÖ Narrow bid-ask spreads
- ‚úÖ Consistent daily trading
- ‚úÖ Many buyers and sellers

### Low Liquidity Means:
- ‚ùå Difficult to buy/sell without moving the price
- ‚ùå Wide bid-ask spreads
- ‚ùå Irregular trading (gaps between trading days)
- ‚ùå Few market participants
- ‚ùå Risk of being "stuck" in a position

## The Four Pillars of ISX Liquidity

Our hybrid scoring system evaluates liquidity across four key dimensions:

### 1. üìä Price Impact (35% weight)
**What it measures**: How much the stock price moves when you trade

**Based on**: Amihud ILLIQ measure - the relationship between price changes and trading volume

**What it tells you**:
- Lower score = Your trades move the price significantly
- Higher score = You can trade without disturbing the price
- Critical for large trades or institutional investors

**Example**: 
- Stock A with high price impact score (80): Trading 10M IQD moves price by ~0.5%
- Stock B with low price impact score (20): Trading 10M IQD moves price by ~3%

### 2. üí∞ Trading Value (30% weight)
**What it measures**: Average daily trading value in Iraqi Dinars (IQD)

**Calculated as**: 60-day Simple Moving Average including non-trading days

**What it tells you**:
- Higher values = More money flowing through the stock daily
- Lower values = Limited trading interest
- Indicates market depth and institutional interest

**Example**:
- Bank stock: 500M IQD daily average = High liquidity
- Small industrial: 5M IQD daily average = Low liquidity

### 3. üìÖ Trading Continuity (20% weight)
**What it measures**: How consistently the stock trades

**Calculated as**: Percentage of days with trading activity in the 60-day window

**What it tells you**:
- 90%+ continuity = Trades almost every day
- 50% continuity = Trades only half the days
- <30% continuity = Sporadic, unreliable trading

**Why it matters**:
- Continuous trading = Easy entry and exit
- Gaps in trading = Risk of being unable to sell when needed

### 4. üìà Spread Proxy (15% weight)
**What it measures**: Estimated bid-ask spread using high-low price data

**Based on**: Corwin-Schultz spread estimator

**What it tells you**:
- Lower spreads = Lower transaction costs
- Higher spreads = More expensive to trade
- Indicates market maker activity and competition

- Low spread proxy
- High daily value

#### 2. Swing Trading (Few Days to Weeks)
**Required Score**: 50+
**Focus on**:
- Moderate continuity (>70%)
- Acceptable price impact
- Consistent patterns

#### 3. Long-term Investment
**Required Score**: 30+ (can tolerate lower)

4. **Optimal**: Recommended size based on typical patterns

**Example for BBOB (Score: 89)**:
- Conservative: 15M IQD (virtually no price movement)
- Moderate: 30M IQD (slight price movement)
- Aggressive: 60M IQD (noticeable but acceptable movement)
- Optimal: 35M IQD (best balance)

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Choosing Between Two Bank Stocks

**Stock A: BBOB**
- Hybrid Score: 89
- Continuity: 95%
- Daily Value: 250M IQD
- **Decision**: Excellent for any trading strategy

**Stock B: BANK**
- Hybrid Score: 45
- Continuity: 60%
- Daily Value: 25M IQD
- **Decision**: Only for small, patient positions

### Example 2: Planning a 100M IQD Investment

**Approach**:
1. Filter stocks with score >70
2. Check safe trading values
3. Split across 3-4 stocks
4. Enter positions over 2-3 days
5. Monitor liquidity scores for changes

## Key Takeaways

1. **Liquidity = Flexibility**: Higher scores mean easier entry/exit
2. **Match Strategy to Score**: Day traders need 70+, investors can accept 30+
3. **Respect the Thresholds**: Stay within safe trading values
4. **Monitor Changes**: Liquidity can improve or deteriorate
5. **Diversify by Liquidity**: Mix high and moderate liquidity stocks

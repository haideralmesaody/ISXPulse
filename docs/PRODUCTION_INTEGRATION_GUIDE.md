---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes to Production)

### Step 1: Set Up Your Production Credentials

```powershell
# Run the credential setup script
.\setup-production-credentials.ps1
```

**What this does:**
- Locates your existing Google service account JSON credentials
- Encrypts them using AES-256-GCM with OWASP compliance
- Prepares them for secure embedding in the application
- Validates the encryption process

**Supported credential locations:**
- `dev\credentials.json`
- `credentials.json` (root directory)
- `ISX_CREDENTIALS` environment variable

### Step 2: Build Production Binaries

```powershell
# Build with encrypted credentials embedded
.\build.ps1
```

**What this does:**
- Automatically integrates your encrypted credentials
- Builds all 4 executables with the new security system
- Embeds the Iraqi Investor branded Next.js frontend
- Creates production-ready deployment in `release\` directory

### Step 3: Test License Validation

```powershell
# Start the enhanced web server
cd release
.\web-licensed.exe
```

**Then test:**
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:8080`
2. Navigate to the license page (`/license`)
3. Test license activation with a key from your Google Sheet
4. Verify auto-redirect functionality works
5. Check observability dashboard at `/api/metrics/health`

   curl http://localhost:8080/api/metrics/health
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/metrics/system
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/metrics/license
   ```

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor system resource usage
   - Check operation execution metrics

## Security Considerations

### Production Security Features

1. **Encrypted Credentials**
   - Google service account credentials encrypted with AES-256-GCM
   - Encryption key derived from application binary hash
   - Credentials decrypted only in memory, cleared after use

2. **Binary Protection**
   - SHA-256 integrity verification on startup
   - Anti-debugging and anti-reverse engineering detection
   - Certificate pinning for Google API communication

3. **Runtime Security**
   - Maximum 1000 credential accesses per session
   - 1-hour credential timeout protection
   - Comprehensive audit logging for security events

### Security Monitoring

Monitor these log events for security issues:
- `credential_access_failed` - Failed credential decryption
- `tampering_detected` - Binary integrity violation
- `rate_limit_exceeded` - Potential abuse attempts
- `auth_method` - Authentication method used

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Credentials Not Found**
   - Error: "failed to load secure credentials"
   - Solution: Run `setup-production-credentials.ps1` first

2. **Google Sheets API Errors**
   - Error: "failed to read from sheets"
   - Check: Service account has access to your Google Sheet
   - Check: Sheet ID is correct: `1l4jJNNqHZNomjp3wpkL-txDfCjsRr19aJZOZqPHJ6lc`

3. **License Activation Failures**
   - Check license format in Google Sheet
   - Verify machine ID generation works
   - Check network connectivity to Google APIs

4. **Frontend Not Loading**
   - Verify `web-licensed.exe` was built with embedded frontend
   - Check build logs for frontend compilation errors
   - Ensure port 8080 is not blocked

### Debug Information

Enable verbose logging by setting environment variable:
```powershell
$env:ISX_DEBUG = "true"
.\web-licensed.exe
```

### Support Information

For technical support with the enhanced system:
- **Security Issues**: Check audit logs in `/api/metrics/security`
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor `/api/metrics/performance`
- **License Issues**: Review logs with correlation IDs
- **Integration Issues**: Verify credential encryption and Google Sheet access

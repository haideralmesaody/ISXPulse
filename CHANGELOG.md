### Changed
- **Operations Architecture Clarification** (2025-08-09)

  - Each operation step depends on the output of the previous step:
    1. Scraping produces Excel files
    2. Processing requires Excel files from scraping to create CSV
    3. Indexing requires CSV files from processing to extract indices
    4. Analysis requires indexed data from indexing step
  - The data pipeline is inherently sequential by design

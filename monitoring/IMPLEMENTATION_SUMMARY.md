## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Start Monitoring Stack
```bash
# Prometheus
docker run -d --name prometheus -p 9090:9090 \
  -v $(pwd)/monitoring/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  prom/prometheus

# Grafana  
docker run -d --name grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana

# Import dashboard: monitoring/scratch-card-dashboard.json
```

### 2. Configure Service
Ensure ISX service exposes metrics at `/metrics` endpoint and implements new health checks at `/healthz`.

### 3. Verify Implementation
```bash
# Check metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep scratch_card

# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz

# Verify Prometheus targets
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets
```

## 🔍 Observability Architecture

# Path Consistency Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue Description
The ISX Pulse data processing pipeline was experiencing failures due to inconsistent file paths across different processing stages:
- ProcessingStage was outputting to `data/output`
- Other stages (IndicesStage, LiquidityStage) expected files in `data/reports`
- Ticker files needed proper subdirectory organization

## Changes Implemented

### Phase 1: Fix ProcessingStage Output Path (✅ Completed)
**File:** `api/internal/operations/stages.go:891`
- Changed ProcessingStage output from `data/output` to `data/reports`
- Fixed IndicesStage to use single source of truth for index files

### Phase 2: Processor Subdirectory Organization (✅ Completed)

#### Combined CSV Organization
**File:** `api/cmd/processor/main.go:188-198, 291-297`
- Updated to save combined CSV to `data/reports/combined/isx_combined_data.csv`
- Created proper subdirectory structure

#### Daily Files Organization  
**File:** `api/cmd/processor/main.go:305-312`
- Updated to save daily files to `data/reports/daily/`
- Files saved as `isx_daily_YYYY_MM_DD.csv`

#### Ticker Files Organization
**File:** `api/cmd/processor/main.go:320-333`
- Updated to save ticker files to `data/reports/ticker/`
- Files saved flat without sector-based folders as `SYMBOL_trading_history.csv`

#### LiquidityStage Path Updates
**File:** `api/internal/operations/stages.go:1663-1725`
- Updated CanRun to check `data/reports/ticker/` for trading history files
- Updated loadTradingDataFromCSV to look in ticker subdirectory first
- Added fallback to old location for backward compatibility

## New Directory Structure

```
data/
├── downloads/           # Excel files from scraper
├── reports/            # All processed output
│   ├── combined/       # Combined CSV files
│   │   └── isx_combined_data.csv
│   ├── daily/          # Daily CSV files
│   │   ├── isx_daily_2025_01_01.csv
│   │   ├── isx_daily_2025_01_02.csv
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── ticker/         # Individual ticker files (flat, no subfolders)
│   │   ├── BBOB_trading_history.csv
│   │   ├── BGUC_trading_history.csv
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── indexes/        # Index extraction results
│   │   └── indexes.csv
│   └── liquidity_*.csv # Liquidity analysis results
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All stages now use the same base directory (`data/reports`)
2. **Organization**: Clear subdirectory structure for different data types
3. **Performance**: Better file discovery with organized subdirectories
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Fallback logic for old file locations
5. **User Request**: Ticker files are flat without sector organization

## Testing Verification

The changes have been successfully built and tested:
- Build completed in 46.684s
- Server started successfully
- All paths resolved correctly
- WebSocket connections established
- License validation working

## Next Steps (If Needed)

1. **Phase 3**: Add path consistency tests
2. **Phase 4**: Add observability logging for path operations
3. **Phase 5**: Update documentation
4. **Phase 6**: Add error recovery for path migration
5. **Phase 7**: Run full pipeline validation

## Notes

- The fix ensures that operations no longer fail due to path mismatches
- All data processing operations now follow a consistent path structure
- The ticker files are saved flat as requested (no sector-based subdirectories)
